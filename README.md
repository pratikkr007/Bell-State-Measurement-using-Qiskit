# Bell-State-Measurement-using-Qiskit
This project involved implementing a quantum circuit using Qiskit to generate and analyze a Bell state. The circuit was designed with Hadamard and CNOT gates to create entanglement between two qubits. The EstimatorV2 primitive was employed to measure observables like ZZ, ZI, and IX, with the results visualized using Matplotlib for effective analysis.
